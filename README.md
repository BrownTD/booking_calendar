# Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking-calendar.git
```
Since the project only uses HTML and CSS, integrate it directly into your WIX Website using Velo without needing additional scripts:
```
<!-- Link the CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">

<!-- Embed the booking calendar HTML -->
<div class="booking-calendar">
  <!-- Insert your calendar HTML here -->
</div>
```

# Next Steps

- ## Integrate the HTML & CSS:
1. Embed the booking calendar’s HTML code into a custom element on the Wix site.
2. Link the CSS file through the Wix Editor or Velo’s asset management system to ensure proper styling.
- ## Set Up the Wix Database:
3. Create a new database collection on the Wix site to store all booking data.
4. Define the necessary fields (e.g., date, time, service type, guest count) based on project requirements.
- ## Connect via Wix Velo API:
5. Utilize Wix Velo’s API (such as wix-data) to manage interactions between the booking calendar and the database.
6. Implement logic to capture booking form data and perform the required CRUD operations on the database.
- ## Test the Integration:
7. Verify that all form inputs from the booking calendar are captured correctly.
8. Ensure data is successfully inserted into and retrieved from the Wix database.
9. Debug any issues related to data flow or API interactions.
- ## Finalize and Deploy:
10. Once testing is complete and functionality is confirmed, finalize the integration.
11.  Deploy the updated Wix site with the integrated booking calendar and connected database.
- ## Documentation & Handover:
12. Update the project documentation with relevant configuration details and instructions for future maintenance.
13. Communicate all necessary information with me
